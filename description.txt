Sharks?
Lasers?
Laser sharks?

Why not all three, with Sharks with Lasers!

Create a laser collar and put it on your not-so-friendly water puppies so they may randomly shoot things they are looking at! Its so evil it brings a tear to my eye. An evil tear of course.

If you have the resources to spare, you might even be able to create a robotic version that is stronger, tougher, and can even swim in lava! (and can also wear a laser collar of course)



Planned Additions:

Laser alarm
Laser gun
Vat of acid
Piranhas (+ robot version)
Redstone countdowns
Monocle
